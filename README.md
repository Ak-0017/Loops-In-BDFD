> Before you can use any type of loops, you need to learn [how to escape code](../main/Escaping.md).

# Running a code for each item in a list.
Imagine a list of numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., 10), and your goal is to get rid of every item that is bigger than 3. This should be done with a “For Each Loop” because you do something to each item in the list (check if it’s bigger than 3).

Here are 2 ways that I can remember off the top of my head. I recommend the first one, but you can also use the other.
- **[`$replaceText` method](../main/For%20Each%3A%20%24replaceText.md)** (recommended)
- **[`$joinSplitText` method](../main/For%20Each:%20$joinSplitText.md)**

# Running a code a specific amount of times.
Imagine you want to list all even numbers from X to Y. This should be done with this loop because you will be executing a code a specific amount of times.

Here are 2 ways that I can remember off the top of my head. I recommend the first one, but you can also use the other.
- **[`$repeatMessage` method](..)** (recommended)
- **[Another method](..)**

# Running a code all the time.
Will write this section soon.
