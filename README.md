> Before you can use any type of loops, you need to learn [how to escape code](Escaping.md).

# Running a code for each item in a list.
Imagine a list of numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., 10), and your goal is to get rid of every item that is bigger than 3. This should be done with a “For Each Loop” because you do something to each item in the list (check if it’s bigger than 3). I recommend the first method, and that’s the one I always use, but you’re welcome to use any method you want.

Here are 5 example methods, the first two are more complicated, but they prevent the execution of user provided scripts:
- **[`$replaceText` method](For%20Each%3A%20%24replaceText.md)**
- **[`$joinSplitText` method](For%20Each%3A%20%24joinSplitText.md)**
- **[`$replaceText` method (unsafe)](For%20Each%3A%20%24replaceText%20(unsafe).md)**
- **[`$joinSplitText` method (unsafe)](For%20Each%3A%20%24joinSplitText%20(unsafe).md)**
- **[`$repeatMessage` method](For%20Each%3A%20%24repeatMessage.md)** (Thank you [@Kurito](https://github.com/Kourito))

# Running a code a specific amount of times.
Imagine you want to list all even numbers from X to Y. This should be done with this loop because you will be executing a code a specific amount of times. I recommend the first method because it’s easier, but I rarely use it, but you’re welcome to use any method you want.

Here are 2 example methods:
- **[`$repeatMessage` method](Run%20X%20Times%3A%20%24repeatMessage.md)**
- **[Another method](Run%20X%20Times%3A%20Other%20method.md)**

# Running a code all the time.
An example use case of it would be a reminder command, or a giveaway command. \
This loop executes a specified code every specified duration. \
